		In the current study, we aim to challenge the problem of
		learning the musculoskeletal dynamics (MSD) with several
		simpler machine learning techniques, looking for more computationally
		efficient solution. MSD requires high-dimensional transformations of
		posture into muscle properties (moment arms and length) important
		for the generation of joint torques. In the presented work, we solve
		the problem of mapping the joint posture in terms of angles with
		respect to the DOF, onto the moment arms and lengths of corresponding
		muscle(s), without explicit description of the relation, but using the
		data-driven machine learning approach.
